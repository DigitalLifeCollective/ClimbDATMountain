# ClimbDATMountain
Official repository for tools created for the Climb DAT Mountain project

The objective of the project is to identify advantages of decentralized web technologies for online and offline education.
We also want to be open about the limitations of current technologies (for example, IP addresses can be disclosed if you are not using an anonymizer service), so that educators can determine whether these technologies fit with their organizations threat model.  This project will have dependencies on future versions of the DAT protocol and Beaker Browser, so it will evolve as new features such as DAT Mounts, Identity, and Multiwriter are released.

The current prototype attempts to demonstrate features of an online class which enable an instructor to publish web pages within a framework based on Polymer (a client-side framework similar to Node.js).  There is a desire to implement concepts described by Ted Nelson in order to use EDL's (edit-decision lists) in the construction of the pages and navigation links, preserving links and transclusions (material cited from original sources).  Future DAT encryption technologies (such as the Noise framework) may also provide a means to enable TransCopyright, where users can make micropayments for content they want to license.
